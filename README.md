# Windows-Cleanup

This is a bat file meant to be run with administrator privileges that runs a combination of `dism`, `sfc` and `cleanmgr` commands in order to check and repair system health and remove unused system components.

Running the bat file removes the ability to roll back Windows Updates including Service Packs.
